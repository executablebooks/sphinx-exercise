# Release v1.1.0

**Release Date**: TBD

This release adds comprehensive internationalization (i18n) support to sphinx-exercise, enabling the extension to display exercise and solution labels in 27 different languages.

## ✨ New Features

### Internationalization Support

The extension now supports **27 languages** with automatic language detection:

**East Asian**: Chinese (zh_CN), Japanese (ja), Korean (ko)

**South Asian**: Bengali (bn), Hindi (hi), Tamil (ta)

**Middle Eastern**: Arabic (ar), Turkish (tr)

### Automatic Language Detection

The extension automatically detects your Sphinx project's language configuration and applies the appropriate translations:

```python
# conf.py
language = 'zh_CN'  # Chinese
```

```yaml
# _config.yml (Jupyter Book)
sphinx:
  config:
    language: ja  # Japanese
```

### Translation Examples

With language configured, directive labels automatically translate:

- **Spanish**: "Exercise" → "Ejercicio", "Solution to" → "Solución a"
- **Chinese**: "Exercise" → "练习", "Solution to" → "解答"
- **Japanese**: "Exercise" → "練習", "Solution to" → "解答"
- **French**: "Exercise" → "Exercice", "Solution to" → "Solution de"
- **German**: "Exercise" → "Übung", "Solution to" → "Lösung zu"
- **Arabic**: "Exercise" → "تمرين", "Solution to" → "الحل لـ"
- **Hindi**: "Exercise" → "अभ्यास", "Solution to" → "समाधान"
