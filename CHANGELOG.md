# Changelog

## Unreleased

### New ✨

- Added `solution_collapsed` configuration option to render all solutions folded by default ([#84](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-exercise/issues/84))
  - Set to `True` to add the `dropdown` class to every solution, so readers opt in to seeing the answer
  - Works with both the `{solution}` directive and gated `{solution-start}` / `{solution-end}` pairs
  - Directive-level `:class:` values are preserved, and `:class: toggle-shown` keeps an individual solution expanded
  - Requires `sphinx_togglebutton`; a warning is issued during HTML builds if it is not loaded
  - Default is `False`, which maintains the original behaviour

## [v1.2.1](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-exercise/tree/v1.2.1) (2025-11-17)

### Fixes 🐛

- Fixed `ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list` when building LaTeX/PDF output ([#82](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-exercise/pull/82))
  - Added defensive check before removing 'std-ref' class in `UpdateReferencesToEnumerated` transform
  - The 'std-ref' class may not be present in all build scenarios (particularly LaTeX/PDF builds)
  - Fix ensures compatibility across different Sphinx builders and versions
- Fixed flaky CI tests caused by matplotlib font cache warning appearing in test output
  - Added regex patterns to strip matplotlib font cache stderr messages from test regression fixtures

## [v1.2.0](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-exercise/tree/v1.2.0) (2025-11-05)

### New ✨

- Added `exercise_style` configuration option to control solution title styling ([#81](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-exercise/pull/81))
  - Set to `"solution_follow_exercise"` to simplify solution titles to just "Solution" (no hyperlinks, no exercise references)
  - Default is `""` (empty string) which maintains the original behavior: "Solution to Exercise #.#" with clickable hyperlink
- Added order validation system when `exercise_style = "solution_follow_exercise"` ([#81](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-exercise/pull/81))
  - Validates that solutions appear after their referenced exercises
  - Validates that solutions are in the same document as their exercises
  - Provides helpful warnings with file paths and line numbers
  - Warnings are prefixed with `[sphinx-exercise]` for clarity

### Improved 👌

- Enhanced solution title styling options for better UX in lecture-style content where solutions follow exercises
- Improved configuration option naming for better clarity when used alongside other Sphinx extensions
- Cleaner code in `post_transforms.py` with removed redundant title building logic

CI and pre-commit files.

## [v0.4.0](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-exercise/tree/v0.4.0) (2022-3-18)

### New ✨

Added gated directive syntax for `exercise` and `solution` directives, which provides
an alternative syntax for building `exercise` and `solution` that may also include
executable code.

**Example:**

You may now use `exercise-start` and `exercise-end` to define the exercise which may
include any type of text, directives and roles between the start and end markers.

````md
```{exercise-start}
:label: ex1
```

```{code-cell}
# Some setup code that needs executing
```

and maybe you wish to add a figure

```{figure} img/example.png
```

```{exercise-end}
```
````

This can also be used with `solution-start` and `solution-end`.

See [docs](https://ebp-sphinx-exercise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax.html#alternative-gated-syntax) for further details
