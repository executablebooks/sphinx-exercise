### Improved 👌

Made bottom and top padding of directives the same as admonitions in order to fix any other padding issues when the directives use the dropdown class option. We also updated the link of the solution directive title to target only the exercise portion in order to avoid confusion.

### Fixes 🐛

Fixed `doctree-resolve` method in the event the extension is imported but not used.
